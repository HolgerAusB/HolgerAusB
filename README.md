- 👋 Hi, I’m @HolgerAusB
- 👀 I’m interested in home automation, raspberry pi, plex media server
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github ;-) but didn't find a good German documentation yet
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects. I am not a developper at all. But I can read simple code and transform them to my needs.
